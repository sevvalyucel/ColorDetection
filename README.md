# Yellow Object Detection Application

Simple OpenCV project for detecting yellow objects

This project is developed using Python and OpenCV to **detect yellow objects in an image using the HSV color space**.  
Detected yellow objects are highlighted with rectangular bounding boxes on the screen.  

## Features
- Filtering yellow color range in HSV color space
- Detecting yellow objects using masking and contour analysis
- Drawing bounding boxes around detected objects
- Works with both camera feed and static images

## Use Cases
- Color-based object tracking
- Simple computer vision applications
- Educational image processing experiments
